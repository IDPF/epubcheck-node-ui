The node server provides a simple UI that wraps epubcheck.  

To setup the server, use the ant build script. Running 'ant setup' will make sure all the dependencies are in place.

To run the server type node checkserver.js.  If you use the '-h' option you will see the various options that are available.
Once the server is running, browse to http://localhost:port#.  The default port number is 8080.

The 'Check Messages' tab is for modifying the overrides files used by epubcheck.  By default it lists all messages that epubcheck can emit.

The 'Comparison' Tab is for comparing the output between two versions of the same epub.

All of the other tabs provide information about the epub selected in the 'Files' tab.
